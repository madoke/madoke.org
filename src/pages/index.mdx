## About me

Currently, I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Truphone](https://truphone.com) where I work mostly in mentoring and distributed system architecture across several teams. Prior to my current role I've worked as a Tech Lead, doing similar work but on a smaller scale. Before Truphone, I worked mostly as a backend Software Developer in the media industry for some years, at [Sky](https://www.sky.uk) and [Grupo Impresa](https://www.impresa.pt).

Outside work, I'm pushing it hard to be a cool father that plays video games, builds legos, contributes to open-source, side projects and occasionally does some outdoor activity like trail running. I'm also interested in motorsport (mostly formula 1) and cryptocurrencies.

## About this app

It's a small static website where I try to build my personal brand, where I also share some thoughts and opinions on software engineering and life in general.

I also use it to experiment with some stuff like [React](https://reactjs.org), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io]), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). Currently, I'm (trying to) monetizing it with [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) and at the moment I don't track users with any kind of third party analytics (at least not intentionally).

## Contact

You can reach me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsimao/) or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/madoke). If you need, you can encrypt the messages with my [PGP public key](/pgp/pgp.public.txt). I'll try my best to get back to you!
