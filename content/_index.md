Hello! my name is David and I'm a Software Engineer based in Lisbon. I currently work at [Moonpay](https://moonpay.com) as a senior backend developer, specializing in payments. Previously I worked at [Truphone](https://www.truphone.com/) where I did mostly IC work as a Staff engineer. I've also worked in media for some years as a backend developer, at [Sky](https://www.sky.com/) and [Grupo Impresa](https://www.impresa.pt). 

I've been building backend microservices throughout most of my career, but also did a bit of web/mobile development and some legacy monolith decoupling projects. I'm fond of good old Java, but have worked mostly with Typescript and Rust in the recent years.

Outside work I usually spend my time playing video games and coding on pet projects, as well as doing other things that dont involve a computer like brewing beer at home, running and watching motorsport (mostly formula 1).
